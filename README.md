# Reddit Scraper

I've created a web app that lets users view the latest Reddit news via scraping. But you're not going to actually write any articles; instead, you'll flex your Mongoose and Cheerio muscles to scrape news from another site.

This is built using Node, Express, Mongo, Mongoose, Cheerio, Axios, and a MVC Paradigm; for assignment 13 of UMN's Coding Bootcamp.
